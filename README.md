## Homework 1: Supervised Learning Algorithm Comparison and Analysis
## This is the supervised learning analysis report for homework 1. I obtained two data sets from UCI Machine Learning Repository, and implemented Decision Tree, Neural Network, Boosting SVM and KNN algorithms to build a machine learning model to solve two classification problems. 
## The process begin with analyzing the input data and some easy feature engineering. Then use cross validation and grid search to find the best hyper parameters. Third step is to draw a learning curve with the best hyper parameters. Last step is to train the model with all the training data and get a score on the testing data to measure the model.
## The report is divided by the data set. Some future work is also brought up to make the model more accurate or generalized for all the data.
