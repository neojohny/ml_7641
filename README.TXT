All the work including original data, jupyter notebook are saved at https://github.com/neojohny/ml_7641/tree/master/homework1.
Another backup is saved at https://b.gatech.edu/2FZeNJR.

I used Jupyter notebook to finish the homework. The file name is homework1-final.ipynb.
There are three packages I used that might need to install for the code to run.
pip install -U pandas
pip install -U numpy
pip install -U scikit-learn
Especially for the scikit-learn package, I need it to be after 0.22 version for the learning curve to work.

You can basically follow alone the codes to get the result.

Thanks for grading my homework.
